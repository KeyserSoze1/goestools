About the satellites and the signals (GOES-R series):

* HRIT/EMWIN: https://www.goes-r.gov/hrit_emwin/ATR-2010-5482.pdf
* GOES Rebroadcast (GRB): https://www.goes-r.gov/users/docs/GRB_downlink.pdf

Since HRIT is a higher baud rate LRIT, all the docs about the LRIT
signal and file format still apply:

* http://www.noaasis.noaa.gov/LRIT/pdf-files/3_LRIT_Receiver-specs.pdf
* http://www.noaasis.noaa.gov/LRIT/pdf-files/4_LRIT_Transmitter-specs.pdf
* http://www.noaasis.noaa.gov/LRIT/pdf-files/5_LRIT_Mission-data.pdf
* All PDFs at http://www.noaasis.noaa.gov/LRIT/pdf-files/ are useful,
  in particular the receiver specs, transmitter specs, and mission
  data documents.

The blog series by Lucas Teske is a great resource:
