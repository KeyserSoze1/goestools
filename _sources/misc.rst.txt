   The demodulator works as follows.  In the first stage of the
   demodulator automatic gain control is applied to the signal. Next, it
   is fed to a Costas loop to compensate for frequency difference. Then,
   a root-raised cosine filter is applied. Finally, clock recovery runs
   to produce a single complex sample per symbol (293883 per second for
   LRIT or 927000 per second for HRIT).

   The decoder takes a stream of "soft" bits (floating point numbers in
   the range [-1.0, +1.0]), performs synchronization, runs the Viterbi
   decoder, a derandomizer, and finally Reed-Solomon error correction.
   Every valid packet is published on a nanomsg socket.
